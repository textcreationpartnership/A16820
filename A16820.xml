            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>And yet I am not ſo voyd of al hope of their recouery, that I would refuſe to conferre wyth them, touching that authoritie of remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinnes or other preheminence, which the Prieſtes of Chriſtes Church doo clayme, and they ſo earneſtlie controll.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:184:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> his Church doth remitte ſinnes. The more plaine and more exact our maſter Chriſte was in the beſtowing of that power to remitte and reteine ſinnes, the more is our contempt in the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience &amp; deniall thereof. He ſendeth them forth with his owne authoritie in this caſe: he geueth them the very ſpirit of God, by whoſe diuine power they maie execute the function to which he called them: he geueth them the expreſſe warrant of his own woord that ſinnes they might pardon and puniſh: and yet we make doubt of their vſurpation. But howe they mighte forgeue ſinnes by Chriſtes ſending, we haue alreadie ſaid.</p>
               <p>Nowe for the holie Ghoſtes power &amp; prerogatiue in the ſame action, which was breathed on the Apoſtles, we muſt further conferre with ſuche as call in queſtion matters ſo plaine. And firſte I am in good hope, that no man will denie, but Chriſt gaue them the holie Ghoſt for no other purpoſe ſo much, as to remitte ſinnes: ſecondly I doubt not of their faith and beliefe in this point,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:184:32"/> but they wil confeſſe the holy Ghoſt to be of power by nature and propriety to forgeue ſinnes: Thirdlie I claime of their ſinceritie thus muche more, that Chriſt being as wel God as man, was well able for the furniture of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to geue them the holy Ghoſt: all which being confeſſed of al men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied of no Chriſtian aliue, how the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

In the Apoſtles there can be no lacke touching that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, for the execution whereof they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued both Chriſtes commiſſion firſt, and the holy Spirit of God afterward: In Chriſt there can be no default, who was well able to geue, and in deede did giue the holie Ghoſt: In the holie Ghoſte there can be no lette nor lacke, whoſe power is infinite, and his verie propriety to remitte ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Al things then ſtanding on ſo ſafe and ſure groundes, the giuer, the gift, and the receiuer competent, and fullie anſwerable eche to other on euery ſide, let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted ioyne in argument, let

But briefly to ſatiſfie all ſides in this caſe, I ſhall declare the like power to be left by Chriſtes meaning to all Biſhopes &amp; prieſtes, no leſſe then to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles them ſelues, to whome Chriſt then preſently ſpake: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peoples lacke of vnderſtanding may be correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

               <p>Firſt this is playn, that what ſo euer Chriſte after his reſurrection or before did inſtitute for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people &amp; weale of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Churche,<note place="margin">The povver geuen to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſed not by their death, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth ſtill in the Church.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> did not decay in the perſons of them to whome Chriſt preſently ſpake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes, for el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les all ſacramentes had ben ended, and all gouernement ceaſſed at the death of them to whome in perſon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charge was firſt geuen by Chriſte.

                  <hi>doe this:</hi> yet in their perſons, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church was ſo inſtructed and all prieſtes ſo authorized, that the ſame ſome raigne worcke hath vpon that warrant ben truely practiſed of the Church, and by vayne imitation folowed by thier Aduerſaries euen till this daye. And in deede, the verie woordes of the inſtitution did importe no leſſe, for it is ſayde: <hi>Mortem Domini annunciabitis

                  </hi> whiche coulde not be, if the miniſterie had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed with their perſons, to whome Chriſt ſpake. So y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charge both of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and baptiſing was geuen to a fewe choſen men then preſent, but that all the worlde might perceiue, that of his wiſdom and carefull prouidence the charge and authoritie perteined to the gouernours of the Church for euer no leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to them, whom he then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to that function, he added: <hi>I wil be with you to the ende of the worlde,</hi> Meaning that they ſhould exerciſe that office in his name and aſſiſtance to the day of iudgment.<note place="margin">Math. vlt</note> Which in theyr own perſons was not true, but in their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours.

But in deed none doe ſo much iniury to Gods glorie, as thoſe which breake his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, and make a diuiſion of that charge and commiſſion, whiche he geueth. For ſeing our Lord Ieſus his own mouth ſpake theſe words: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ye the holy Ghoſt, whoſe ſinnes you doe forgeue, they be forgeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and whoſe ſinnes you holde, they be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:</hi> Who in this caſe more honoureth God?

Thus ſaid S.

               <p>But they haue a faith ſo ſolitary now a dayes, that it will alone apprehende what ye liſt, and reache ſo farre into Chriſtes iuſtice, that her fautors ſhall haue no need of chriſtian woorkes, or fruitful repentance.</p>
               <p>Now to this ende haue we ſaied all this, that the faithful may vnderſtand perfectly, what the <hi>Pope</hi> may by right remitte through his Pardon and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence.<note place="margin">Note vvel.</note> For looke what the officers of Gods Church may bind, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt may they vpon good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Therefore if they may enioyne penance for yeres and dayes, both openly out of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and alſo in priuate ſatiſfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after Confeſſion, then may they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe certaine daies and yeares of the ſame penance whiche was preſcribed before.

               <p>And therefore I ioyne in argument and open reaſon with our Aduerſaries thus: To geue pardon in moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon and catholike ſenſe of that woord, is to releaſe ſome parte, or all the enioyned penaunce for ſinnes remitted: But the Pope, becauſe he is the principall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of Gods Church, may releaſe any penaunce enioyned, vpon iuſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: <hi>ergo,</hi> the Pope may laufully geue Pardons. The <hi>Minor,</hi> wherein the Aduerſaries may perchance geue back, I proue thus: That which was bound by the Churches or Popes authority, may be laufully looſed by the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority agayne, becauſe Chriſt hym ſelfe ioyned in hys graunte both theſe actes together, &amp; they are proued to be propre
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:184:168"/> to one iuriſdction: But the Church by the Decrees of Biſhops &amp; Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels hath apoynted ſuch penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; ſo many yeres of correction for ſundry faults: therefore the ſame Byſhops or ſuche as be of the like authority, when they ſee occaſion, may remit the penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the ſayd yeres or ſom part of it by limitation of dayes or ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as the ſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, or the time it ſelf doth moue them.</p>

               <p>And therefore, not onely Chriſt him ſelfe, as I ſhall declare hereafter, but Aaron alſo healed in the old lawe the

If the ſimple vnderſtand me not, let him marke my meaning by an example: The paines of Hel can not, neither by God nor ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ordinarily be holpen or releaſed, after man be in the ſame, but the debt of Hell which is due for euery mortall ſinne, is diſcharged alwayes at oure repentaunce, in ſo muche that the prieſt in the ſacrament of Penaunce, with the ſinne euer remitteth the bonde of Hell, and preuenteth Gods iudgement in the ſame: So if <hi>Purgatorie</hi> coulde not at all belong to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, nor no perſon therein, yet in the life of, the party ſom peece of the debt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of or all may be releaſed afore hande, whiles the party is in the power of the Church &amp; her diſcipline.

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:184:216"/> of eche member therof: Yea more then that, the holy ſuffering and tribulation of holie Sanctes, as of oure Bleſſed Ladie Chriſtes mother,<note place="margin">Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Sainctes.</note> and the holie Apoſtles, with numbers of conſtant Martirs, Confeſſours, and Virgins, helpe to ſupplie oure lacke alſo, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the huge treaſure of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Churche, for the ſatisfying for oure ſinnes, which yet notwithſtanding, as they were me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious to the ſufferers, be fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by the glorie of Chriſtes king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and eternall felicitie, which farre excedeth not onely the merites of all Sanctes, but ſufficiently rewardeth the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ility &amp; obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chriſt to his Father, in ſuffering death vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe, though his workes as they be ſatisfactorie for vs, are not yet anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in vs nor ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be til y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlds end.</p>
               <p>And for Chriſt in this caſe our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries perchaunce would not muche ſticke with vs, but for the remaines of Sanctes ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not abide. And if S. Paule in expreſſe woordes did not vtter this my meaning concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the trauaile of holie Sanctes for
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:184:217"/> Chriſtes bodie, which ys his Churche, the litle holy ones of theſe daies wold haue ſpurned at theſe kind of ſpeaches, for feare of dooing iniurie to Chriſt, of whoſe honoure the good men make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues ſo tender.<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1.</note> Theſe woordes then doth S. Paule vtter of his trauaile ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the Churches ſake: <hi>Now I doo reioice in my paſsions or tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, taken for youre ſake, and I fulfill thoſe thinges that doo wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſts paſsions, in my owne fleſhe, for his bodie which is the Churche.</hi> Thus ſaid S. Paule. Wherby you ſee, that not onely the want of one me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber maye be ſupplied of the head of the body, but that eche member may helpe the infuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficencie of an other member.</p>
               <p>Whereby for all that, we maye not conceiue, that there is any lacke or inſufficiencie on Chriſtes parte or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which was ſo full and abundant of it owne valure, that by it ſelfe alone without the helpe of all mans merites or other creatures, it was a ſufficient price for the ſinnes of all the worlde, &amp; moe if moe might be. But the lacke that
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:184:217"/> this his paſſion was not in effecte ſo forcible and ſo fully in al mens caſes, was the want of ſome paynes and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in his body the Churche, by which ſhe and euerie of hers were bounde to conforme them ſelues vnto Chriſt, by taking paynes in their fleſhe and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together with Chriſt their heade. For ſo long Chriſtes paſſion wanteth his due effecte in vs, (thoughe it were neuer ſo full and ſufficient in ti ſelfe) as we do not conforme oure ſelues to his paine and tribulation taken for vs. Therefore, though Chriſt in his owne perſon ſuffer now no more, yet he doth ſuffer, and dayly ſhall ſuffer till the worldes ende in diuers me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of his holy bodie, as the heade, ſaith S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine ſuffereth when the finger aketh, &amp; as Chriſt him ſelfe charged S. Paule that he perſecuted him,<note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> when he onely moleſted his members. And ſo long as the Churche militant trauaileth here in earth, ſo long hath Chriſt oure Maiſter ſomwhat to ſuffer to make his paſſion effectuall in ſuche as ſhall be ſaued, and in that ſenſe ſome peece of his paſſion,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:184:218"/> in euerie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithfulls bodies muſt be ſupplied. By al which holy paines of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head him ſelfe principally &amp; of the holy members of his bodie, who wrought not onely for them ſelues, but expreſly mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to benefite other by their works, as the Apoſtle confeſſeth of him ſelfe, we neede not to doubt, but the lacke of manie a poore member of this bleſſed incorporation, is duly ſupplied, and the wante of worke ſatisfactorie in ſome, recompenſed by the aboundance of paines and penaunce of others. For this is the bleſſed caſe of ſuche as be in the Churche of God, in the felowſhipp of the faithfull, in the knotte of thoſe members, whereof oure Sauioure is the heade, that is to ſaie, in the holye communion of Sanctes, in which as ſome doo lack, ſo other ſom by Chriſts gifte doo abunde and are hable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure mercie for the needie, and to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie God for their poore brethrens ſinnes.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 8.</note> And yet all this intercourſe of benefites and mutuall helpes paſſeth not from the heade to the members, nor from one member of the body to an
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:184:218"/> other, but by the ordinarie means of Chriſtes appointment, as by ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, ſacrifice, and ſundrie wayes of his ſeruice, &amp; that not without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſtery of men, in whome he hath put y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woorde of this reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliation, to whome he hath committed his keyes to kepe, his ſheep to feede, his myſteries to diſpoſe, and to whome finally he hath giuen full power both to binde and looſe.</p>
               <p>Lette no man marueile, that in ſuch a face of Goddes iuſtice, as we ſee by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enioyning of greate penaunce in the Church after ſinnes be remitted, &amp; by Gods owne often ſcourgies temporal both in this world &amp; in the next, let no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (I ſay) marueile, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yet ther be ways of Goddes mercy, and meanes through the miniſterie of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to turne away the wrath of our Lord, &amp; by other helpes to ſatisfie his iuſtice again.

               <p>Lette them conſider that doubt of this point, how often God hath, as it were, determined to plague the people of Iſraell, which he choſe to be his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, and yet in the midſt of his decree and iuſtice, hath giuen mercy and grace at Moyſes and Aarons requeſtes: Yea, how often he hath, as it were, procured the iuſt to ſtande betwixt him and the people whome he meant to puniſhe. <hi>Manſuetum habemus Dominum,</hi>
