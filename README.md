    _ Here it is declared by ſcripture, that the ſame power of remittinge ſinnes, which God the father by cōmiſsion gaue vnto his ſōne as he was mā, was alſo by Chriſt beſtowed on the Apoſtles after his reſurrection. The ſecond Chapter.

    _ The power of prieſthod touching remiſſion of ſinnes is proued by the ſolemne action of Chriſt, in breathing vpon his Apoſtles, and geuing them therby the holie Ghoſt. The third Chap.

    _ The power to remitte ſinnes is further proued to be giuen to the Apoſtles by theſe woordes of Chriſt: Whoſe ſinnes you doo forgiue &cet. by the doctours expoſition of the ſame, and by conference of other woordes of ſcripture of the like ſenſe. The Fourh Chap.

    _ That the ſame power of remitting and reteining ſinnes, which was giuen to the Apoſtles, was not beſtowed on thē in reſpect of their priuate perſons, but as they were publike officers: and that therefore the like authoritie is common by Chriſtes graunt to all prieſtes of Chriſtes Church, who in this matter are the Apoſtles ſucceſſours. The fifth Chap.

    _ An anſwer to ſuche as deny this power to paſſe from the Apoſtles to all other prieſtes, becauſe many of them being euel men, may be thought not to haue the holy Ghoſt, whereby they ſhould effectually remit ſinnes. The Sixth Chap.

    _ For further prouf of the foreſaid matter, it is declared, that neither Chriſte, nor his euerlaſting Father, nor the holie Ghoſt, doe giue ouer vnto man or reſigne the power of remiſsion, or anie other holie function of the Churche, but doe themſelues cōtinually worke al thoſe graces by mans miniſterie and ſeruice. The eighth Chap.

    _ That remiſsion of mans ſinnes, hath bene ioyned often both in the lawe of nature and Moyſes, to ſome external ceremomonies and ſacrifices, whereof in the old lawe Prieſtes were the appointed miniſters. The Ninth Chap.

    _ Here it is proued, that by the right of the Prieſt in remitting ſinnes, the duetie of all Chriſtian people doth neceſſarilie riſe for the confeſsion of euerie of their mortal ſinnes vnto him: as the ſame is alſo proued by the doctrine of all holye Fathers of Chriſtes Churche. The tenth Chap.

    _ That confeſsion hath euer bene vſed, of al mortal ſinnes, in al coūtries and ages ſince •hriſtes time, it is proued by the witneſſe of moſte learned fathers, with an aunſwer to ſuche thinges as oute of the fathers be ſometimes obiected to the contrarie. The eleuenth Chap.

    _ The concluſion of this treatiſe, remouing, the impedimentes of confeſſion.

    _ The authour by iuſte cauſes was moued to beleue the trueth of this doctrine of Pardōs, before he knewe the meaning of them: and afterwarde founde them to be of greater importaunce, then he tooke them before to be. The firſt Chapter.

    _ For the true meaning of Pardons, and to remoue ſome vntrue ſurmiſes touching the ſame, it is declared that the Pope neuer tooke vppon him by pardon to remitte deadlye ſinne, muche leſſe to giue any man licence to ſinne. The ſecond Chapter.

    _ The Appſtles ād Biſhopes haue euer, beſides the preching of the Goſpel, puniſhed mēs ſins ād practiſed iudgmēt vpō mēs ſoules, both in binding ād looſing. The fyth Chapter.

    _ That there be diuerſe wayes of temporal punniſhment remaining after ſinnes be remitted, euery of whiche wayes may be in ſome caſes releaſed in parte, or in whole, by the Pardons of Popes and Biſshops. The ſixth Chapter.

    _ That not onely the penaunce enioyned in the ſacrament, or otherwiſe by canonical correction, but alſo ſuche paine as God him ſelfe prouideth for ſinne, may be releaſed by the Popes Pardōs, and that Purgatory paines may eſpecially be preuented by the ſame remiſſions. The ſeuenth Chapter.

    _ It is proued as wel by ſundrie examples of the olde Lawe, as by Chriſts owne often facte and his Apoſtles, that enioyned or deſerued puniſhement may be releaſed by the gouernours of the Church in their Pardons. The Ninth Chapter.

    _ That the Churche of God meaneth not to make al men partaker of her Pardōs which would ſeme to be relieued therby, but ſuche onely as be of fit diſpoſition therefore, and how they ought to be qualified, that muſt be partakers thereof. The tenth Chapter.
